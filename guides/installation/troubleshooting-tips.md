# Troubleshooting Tips

If you get an error message like this for **Kibana** , **Elasticsearch** or **Filebeat.**

```
‚óè elasticsearch.service - Elasticsearch

```

Try undoing the changes you have done by, **(#)** commenting you changes then save the file and restart the services. This will confirm if your recent last changes have made the file unstable!

This happens when an entry was not taken in the **.yml** file, the file may be damaged or corrupted.

Once that is done, everything should work after that!



Or you did not give the system enough resources, please power off and go back to.

{% content-ref url="./" %}
[.](./)
{% endcontent-ref %}

And give your Server Enough Memory and CPU for running these Services.
